                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, andMath, and a core set of language elements such as operators, controlstructures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety ofpurposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } <br>greetMe("World");</code>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
                <header>Variable Scope</header>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } <br> console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } <br>console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="constants">
                <header>Constants</header>
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
                <code>
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR <br>
                    function f() {}; <br>
                    const f = 5; <br>
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO <br>
                    function f() { <br>
                        const g = 5; <br>
                        var g; <br>
                        //statements <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="if_else_statement">
                <header>If Else Statement</header>
                <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
                <code>if (condition) { <br> statement_1; <br> } else { <br>statement_2; <br> }</code>
                <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
                <code>
                    if (condition_1) { <br>
                        statement_1; <br>
                    } else if (condition_2) { <br>
                        statement_2; <br>
                    } else if (condition_n) { <br>
                        statement_n; <br>
                    } else { <br>
                        statement_last; <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
                <header>While Statement</header>
                <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
                <code>
                    while (condition) 
                    statement
                </code>
                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
                <code>
                    var n = 0; <br>
                    var x = 0; <br>
                    while (n < 3) { <br> 
                        n++; <br>
                        x += n; <br>
                    }
                </code>
                <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
